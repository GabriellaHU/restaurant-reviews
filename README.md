# Restaurant Reviews

The restaurant review application displays info about several restaurants based on a map API and a filter function.
The site is responsive and fully accessible.

## How to install

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Pre-requisites**: Install [git](https://gitforwindows.org/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer.
1. Get a local copy of this repo by typing: `<git clone https://github.com/GabriellaHU/arcade-game.git>` to the terminal.


2. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) . If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
Run `python -m http.server 8000` on your terminal.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
